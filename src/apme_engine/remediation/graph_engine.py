"""Graph-aware remediation engine — in-memory convergence on ContentGraph.

Replaces the disk-based convergence loop for Tier 1 transforms.  The
``ContentGraph`` acts as a mutable working copy: transforms modify
``ContentNode.yaml_lines`` in memory, dirty nodes are rescanned with
only graph rules (no full pipeline rebuild), and files on disk are
never touched until final approval via ``splice_modifications()``.

See :doc:`/sdlc/research/nodestate-progression-design` for the full
design rationale.
