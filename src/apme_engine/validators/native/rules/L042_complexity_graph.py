"""GraphRule L042: play with high task count (complexity).

Graph-aware port of ``L042_complexity.py``.  Uses ``graph.descendants``
to count tasks within the play's subtree rather than relying on the
flattened ``ctx.sequence``.  This correctly counts tasks within nested
blocks and includes/imports while staying scoped to the play.

The rule matches **PLAY** nodes and reports a single violation per play
when the task count exceeds the threshold.
