"""GraphRule — base class for rules consuming ContentGraph (ADR-044).

In Phase 2, all native rules are ported from ``Rule`` (which consumes
``AnsibleRunContext``) to ``GraphRule`` (which consumes ``ContentGraph``
directly).  This base class is built in Phase 1 so the interface is
stable before porting begins.

Interface contract
------------------
- ``match(graph, node_id)`` → bool: does this rule apply to this node?
- ``process(graph, node_id)`` → GraphRuleResult | None: evaluate the rule

Rules receive the full graph so they can query ancestors, siblings,
descendants, property origins, and variable provenance — capabilities
that were impossible with the flat ``AnsibleRunContext`` sequence.
