# ADR-050: Post-Remediation PR Creation via Gateway SCM Integration

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-04-07

## Context

When APME remediates an Ansible project through the Gateway, the engine returns
patched files in the `SessionResult` protobuf message. The Gateway persists the
remediation record and streams results to the UI — but there is no automated path
to push those changes back to the source repository as a pull request.

Today the remediation lifecycle ends at "here are your fixed files." For
SCM-backed projects (which is the Gateway's primary use case per ADR-037), the
natural next step is committing those fixes to a branch and opening a PR against
the project's default branch. Without this, users must manually download patched
files, create a branch, commit, and open a PR — friction that undermines the
value of automated remediation.

ADR-030 already identifies "PR creation (direct SCM API calls)" as a Gateway
responsibility. This ADR formalizes the design.

### Constraints

- **Engine stays stateless** (ADR-020, invariant 5). The engine never touches
  SCM. PR creation is purely a Gateway concern.
- **Engine never queries out** (invariant 11). The Gateway owns all external
  API calls — SCM provider APIs included.
- **Gateway depends on engine, not the reverse** (invariant, dependency
  direction). The engine has no knowledge of PRs or SCM providers.
- **gRPC between backend services** (invariant 2). PR creation is a Gateway-to-
  external-API operation, not inter-service communication, so this invariant is
  not affected. No new gRPC services are introduced.

### Decision Drivers

- Users expect a "one-click" path from remediation results to a reviewable PR.
- The Gateway already clones repos (it has the SCM URL and branch). Pushing
  changes back is the natural extension.
- Enterprise deployments (AAP, RHDH) need audit trails — a PR with APME as
  author provides that.
- Multiple SCM providers exist (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). The design must
  accommodate all of them without coupling to one.

## Decision

**The Gateway will provide a REST endpoint to create a pull request from a
completed remediation's patched files, using a pluggable SCM provider
abstraction with a hierarchical auth model (project-level overrides global).**

PR creation is user-initiated (not automatic). After reviewing remediation
results in the UI, the user clicks "Create PR" which calls the Gateway API.

### 1. SCM Provider Abstraction

A `ScmProvider` protocol defines the contract for interacting with any SCM
platform:

```python
class ScmProvider(Protocol):
    async def create_branch(self, repo_url: str, base_branch: str, new_branch: str, token: str) -> None: ...
    async def push_files(self, repo_url: str, branch: str, files: dict[str, bytes], commit_message: str, token: str) -> str: ...
    async def create_pull_request(self, repo_url: str, base_branch: str, head_branch: str, title: str, body: str, token: str) -> PullRequestResult: ...
```

A registry maps SCM provider types (`github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`) to
implementations. The provider type is inferred from the repo URL
(`github.com` → `github`, `gitlab.com` → `gitlab`) or set explicitly in the
project/global config for self-hosted instances.

### 2. Hierarchical Auth Model

SCM authentication tokens are resolved with project-level precedence over
global:

| Level | Configuration | Scope |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Project** | `scm_token` field on the Project record | Overrides global for this project |
| **Global** | `APME_SCM_TOKEN` environment variable | Default for all projects without a project-level token |

Token resolution: if the project has `scm_token` set, use it. Otherwise, fall
back to `APME_SCM_TOKEN`. If neither is set, the "Create PR" action is
unavailable (UI disables the button, API returns 422).

Tokens are stored encrypted at rest in the database (project-level) or read
from the environment (global). Tokens are never logged — `[REDACTED]` per
SECURITY.md.

### 3. REST API

```
POST /api/v1/activity/{activity_id}/pull-request
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "branch_name": "apme/remediate-2026-04-07",
  "title": "fix: APME automated remediation",
  "body": "Auto-generated PR with APME remediation results.\n\n..."
}
```

All fields are optional — the Gateway generates sensible defaults:
- `branch_name`: `apme/remediate-{short_scan_id}`
- `title`: `fix: APME remediation — {fixed_count} findings resolved`
- `body`: Markdown summary with violation counts, what was fixed, and a link
  back to the activity detail in the APME UI

Response:

```json
{
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42",
  "branch_name": "apme/remediate-abc123",
  "provider": "github"
}
```

Error responses:
- `404` — activity not found or has no patched files
- `409` — PR already created for this activity (idempotency guard)
- `422` — no SCM token configured (project or global)
- `502` — SCM provider API error (upstream failure)

### 4. Workflow

```
User clicks "Remediate" in UI
        │
        ▼
Gateway runs FixSession → SessionResult with patched files
        │
        ▼
Gateway persists activity record (patched files stored in DB)
        │
        ▼
User reviews results in Activity Detail page
        │
        ▼
User clicks "Create PR"
        │
        ▼
Gateway:
  1. Resolve SCM token (project → global fallback)
  2. Determine SCM provider from repo_url
  3. Create branch from project's default branch
  4. Push patched files to the new branch
  5. Create PR against default branch
  6. Store PR URL in activity record
  7. Return PR URL to UI
        │
        ▼
UI shows PR link — user reviews and merges in SCM
```

### 5. Patched File Storage

The Gateway must retain patched file content from `SessionResult` so that PR
creation can happen asynchronously (user reviews first, clicks later). Patched
files are stored alongside the activity record in the database. Storage is
ephemeral — files are cleaned up when the activity record is deleted or after
a configurable retention period.

### 6. PR Body Generation

The PR body is auto-generated from the activity record and includes:

- Summary of findings resolved (count by severity and rule ID)
- List of files modified
- Link to the APME activity detail page (if the Gateway URL is configured)
- APME version that performed the remediation
- Note that the PR was auto-generated by APME

### 7. Phased SCM Provider Rollout

| Phase | Provider | Implementation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Phase 1** | GitHub | GitHub REST API v3 (`api.github.com` and GitHub Enterprise Server). Uses PAT or GitHub App installation token. Supports `github.com` and self-hosted via configurable base URL. |
| **Phase 2** | GitLab | GitLab REST API v4. Supports `gitlab.com` and self-hosted. |
| **Phase 2** | Bitbucket | Bitbucket Cloud REST API v2 and Bitbucket Server/Data Center. |

Phase 1 is scoped to this ADR. Phase 2 providers follow the same
`ScmProvider` protocol and are added without architectural changes.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Automatic PR Creation on Every Remediation

**Description**: The Gateway automatically creates a PR immediately after every
remediation completes, with no user interaction.

**Pros**:
- Zero friction — fully hands-off
- CI/CD pipelines could trigger remediation and get PRs automatically

**Cons**:
- Creates noise — not every remediation result is worth a PR (user may want to
  review first)
- No opportunity to customize branch name or PR title
- Harder to handle errors (no user present to see failures)
- Unwanted PRs in the repo if remediation produces unexpected changes

**Why not chosen**: Remediation results should be reviewed before committing to
a repository. User-initiated PR creation preserves human oversight. Automatic
mode can be added later as an opt-in project setting without architectural
changes.

### Alternative 2: PR Creation in the Engine or CLI

**Description**: The engine or CLI handles SCM operations (branch, commit, push,
PR) directly.

**Pros**:
- CLI users get PR creation without the Gateway

**Cons**:
- Violates invariant 11 (engine never queries out) and invariant 5 (engine
  stateless)
- CLI already writes patched files to disk — the user can commit from there
- Adds SCM API dependencies to the engine package
- Engine would need SCM tokens, which crosses security boundaries

**Why not chosen**: SCM operations are an external integration — they belong in
the Gateway (presentation/integration layer), not the engine. CLI users already
have local files and can use their own git workflow.

### Alternative 3: Webhook-Based PR via External CI

**Description**: The Gateway emits a webhook event on remediation completion.
An external CI system (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) picks it up and creates the PR.

**Pros**:
- Gateway stays simple — no SCM API client needed
- Leverages existing CI infrastructure

**Cons**:
- Requires external CI configuration per project — not self-contained
- Adds latency (webhook → CI → PR)
- Failure modes are opaque (CI failure != Gateway failure)
- Not available out of the box — users must set up the CI side

**Why not chosen**: Adds operational complexity and external dependencies. The
Gateway already has repo context and auth tokens; calling the SCM API directly
is simpler and self-contained.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Complete remediation loop**: Users go from "violations found" to "PR open"
  without leaving the APME UI.
- **Audit trail**: PRs created by APME are visible in the repo's history,
  providing traceability for compliance.
- **Gateway-contained**: No engine changes. The engine remains stateless and
  SCM-unaware, consistent with invariants 5 and 11.
- **Pluggable providers**: The `ScmProvider` protocol supports multiple SCM
  platforms without architectural changes.
- **Hierarchical auth**: Project-level tokens allow multi-org setups where
  different repos use different credentials, with a global fallback for
  simpler deployments.

### Negative

- **New dependency**: The Gateway gains an HTTP client dependency for SCM API
  calls (e.g., `httpx`). Subject to ADR-019 governance.
- **Token management**: Users must configure SCM tokens. Project-level tokens
  require secure storage (encrypted at rest in the database).
- **Patched file retention**: Storing patched file content in the database
  increases storage requirements. Mitigated by configurable retention and
  cleanup on activity deletion.
- **SCM API rate limits**: High-volume deployments may hit SCM provider rate
  limits. Mitigated by PR creation being user-initiated (not bulk/automatic).

### Neutral

- The CLI is unaffected. CLI users continue to write patched files to disk and
  manage their own git workflow.
- The engine is unaffected. No proto changes, no new RPCs.
- The UI gains a "Create PR" button on the Activity Detail page — a frontend
  change scoped to ADR-037's project-centric model.

## Implementation Notes

### GitHub Provider (Phase 1)

The GitHub provider uses the REST API v3:

1. **Create branch**: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs` — create a ref
   from the base branch's HEAD SHA.
2. **Push files**: `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` for each file,
   or use the Git Trees/Commits API for atomic multi-file commits.
3. **Create PR**: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls` with `head`, `base`,
   `title`, `body`.

For GitHub Enterprise Server, the base URL is configurable per project or
globally via `APME_GITHUB_API_URL`.

### Database Changes

- **Project table**: Add optional `scm_token` column (encrypted text) and
  optional `scm_provider` column (enum: `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, or
  auto-detected from URL).
- **Scan/Activity table**: Add optional `pr_url` column (text). Patched file
  content is stored in a related `patched_files` table with columns
  `(activity_id, path TEXT, content BLOB)`. Files are Ansible YAML (UTF-8
  text) but stored as BLOBs to avoid encoding assumptions. A size cap per
  activity (default 50 MiB total) prevents unbounded growth. Rows are
  cascade-deleted with the parent activity record.

### Configuration

| Setting | Level | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `APME_SCM_TOKEN` | Global (env) | Default SCM token for all projects |
| `APME_GITHUB_API_URL` | Global (env) | GitHub API base URL (default: `https://api.github.com`) |
| `APME_SECRET_KEY` | Global (env) | Symmetric application secret used for encrypting stored SCM tokens at rest |
| `scm_token` | Project (DB) | Per-project SCM token override |
| `scm_provider` | Project (DB) | Explicit provider type (auto-detected if unset) |

### Security Considerations

- Tokens are encrypted at rest in the database using a symmetric key derived
  from the `APME_SECRET_KEY` environment variable (documented in the
  Configuration table above).
- Tokens are never included in API responses, logs, or error messages.
- The "Create PR" endpoint validates that the requesting user has access to
  the project (relevant for enterprise mode with auth).
- SCM API calls use HTTPS only — consistent with the existing `clone_repo`
  restriction to `https://` URLs.

## Related Decisions

- ADR-020: Reporting Service and Event Delivery Model (engine stays stateless)
- ADR-029: Web Gateway Architecture (Gateway owns SCM operations)
- ADR-030: Frontend Deployment Model (PR creation listed as Gateway responsibility)
- ADR-037: Project-Centric UI Model (project as the top-level entity)
- ADR-039: Unified Operation Stream (remediation produces `SessionResult` with patched files)
